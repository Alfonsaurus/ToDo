# ToDo
A simple in-editor To-Do list for Unity.<br />
• Attached as a Component on a GameObject. Can have as many as you want.<br />
• Uses a Custom Inspector based on UnityEditorInternal.ReorderableList.<br />
• Title of ReorderableList can be edited.<br />
• Tasks can be reorganised by dragging the left side.<br />
• Each task includes : Completion tickbox, text area, and the option to link a GameObject, Component or Asset by dragging it onto the task. Cross-scene references are not supported and will be cleared when reloading the scene.<br />
• Completed tasks turn green. Use the "Remove Completed Tasks" button to remove all completed tasks.<br />
• Supports Rich Text, (but is disabled while editing the task, so you can see what you are writing)<br />
• Has Undo / Redo Support.<br />
